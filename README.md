## Features
- **Responsive Layout:** Adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **Header Section:** Includes a logo, navigation links, and a bold title with subtext.
- **Illustrations with Descriptions:** Displays images alongside descriptive text.
- **Call to Action (CTA):** A dedicated section encouraging user interaction.
- **Footer:** Simple and minimalistic footer with copyright information.
